# gh_notifications


-----

`gh_notifications` is a library to access GitHub Notifications. It comes
with a cli & web interface.

Folks who work with many organizations which require SAML authentication
may find this tool more convenient to use, as authentication is handled
by a PAT (avoiding daily login to each SAML backed organization).

_N.B. this project is a learn-by-doing for me on library combined with
cli & web access. Expect rough edges!_
